    "Airflow: open source solution for developing and monitoring worfklows (pipelines)\n",
    "* It defines DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) using Python in DAG files. A DAG file will usually describe the set of tasks and its dependencies, and will also contain metadata which will tell Airflow how and when it should be scheduled.\n",
    "    * DAGs DAGs can be executed efficiently, taking advantage of any parallelism inherent in the dependency structure. \n",
    "* Being written in Python gives flexibility for building DAGs &rarr; generate optional tasks according to conditions, external metadata, configuration files, integrating easily with other systems (databases, cloud services ,etc). \n",

    "### 1.1. Scheduling and executing pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Scheduling is done with Cron-like expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three main components of Airflow:\n",
    "* Airflow scheduler - Parses DAGs, checks schedule interval, passes sccheduled tasks for woerkrs\n",
    "* Airflow worker - picks tasks that are scheduled for exection and execute them &rarr; they do the work\n",
    "* Airflow webserver - visualizations of parsed DAGs and main interface for monitoring DAGs runnings and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Monitoring and handling failures\n",
    "\n",
    "Web interface is used for viewing and monitoring the reuslts of DAG runs. Debugging is also easy due to log records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Incremental loading and backfilling\n",
    "\n",
    "Run DAGs into discrete intervals, building incremental pipelines (ex: DAG only runs on data available after the last DAG run)\n",
    "\n",
    "_backfilling_: execute a new DAG for historical schedule intervals that occurred in the past &rarr; (re)process historical data"
