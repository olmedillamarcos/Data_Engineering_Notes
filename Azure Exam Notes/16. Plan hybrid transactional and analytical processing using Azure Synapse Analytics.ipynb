    "Hybrid Transactional / Analytical Processing (HTAP) is a style of data processing that combines transactional data processing, such as is typically found in a business application, with analytical processing, such as is used in a business intelligence (BI) or reporting solution. The data access patterns and storage optimizations used in these two kinds of workload are very different, so usually a complex extract, transform, and load (ETL) process is required to copy data out of transactional systems and into analytical systems; adding complexity and latency to data analysis. <b>In an HTAP solution, the transactional data is replicated automatically, with low-latency, to an analytical store, where it can be queried without impacting the performance of the transactional system</b>."
