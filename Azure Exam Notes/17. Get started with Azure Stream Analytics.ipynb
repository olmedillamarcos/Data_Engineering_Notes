    "A data stream consists of a perpetual series of data, typically related to specific point-in-time events. For example, a stream of data might contain details of messages submitted to a social media micro-blogging site, or a series of environmental measurements recorded by an internet-connected weather sensor. Streaming data analytics is most often used to better understand change over time. For example, a marketing organization may perform sentiment analysis on social media messages to see if an advertising campaign results in more positive comments about the company or its products, or an agricultural business might monitor trends in temperature and rainfall to optimize irrigation and crop harvesting."

    "* Aggregation of streaming data is performed over temporal windows - for example, recording the number of social media posts per minute or the average rainfall per hour.\n",
    "* The results of streaming data processing can be used to support real-time (or near real-time) automation or visualization, or persisted in an analytical store to be combined with other data for historical analysis. Many solutions combine these approaches to support both real-time and historical analytics.\n"
